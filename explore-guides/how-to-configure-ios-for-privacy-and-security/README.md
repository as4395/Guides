# How to Configure iOS for Privacy and Security

## Step 1: Disable Wi-Fi When Not at Home
- Go to **Settings > Wi-Fi**.
- Turn off Wi-Fi when you’re not home to prevent location tracking through known networks.

## Step 2: Disable Bluetooth When Not in Use
- Go to **Settings > Bluetooth**.
- Turn off unless actively using it (e.g., headphones).
- Bluetooth can be used for tracking and was used for proximity surveillance during COVID-19 by local governments.

## Step 3: Disable Wi-Fi Calling and Calls on Other Devices
- Go to **Settings > Cellular**.
- Disable **Wi-Fi Calling** and **Calls on Other Devices** to compartmentalize your phone from other Apple devices.

## Step 4: Lock Screen Preview Settings
- Go to **Settings > Notifications > Show Previews**.
- Change from **Always** to **When Unlocked** to protect sensitive messages like 2FA codes.

## Step 5: Disable Siri Suggestions
- Go to **Settings > Notifications > Siri Suggestions**.
- Turn off all Siri Suggestions to reduce data collection.

## Step 6: Avoid Using Screen Time
- Go to **Settings > Screen Time**.
- Avoid enabling Screen Time to prevent activity tracking.

## Step 7: Change Device Name
- Go to **Settings > General > About > Name**.
- Change from “[Your Name] iPhone” to something generic like “iPhone.”

## Step 8: Disable Automatic Software Updates
- Go to **Settings > General > Software Updates**.
- Turn off **Automatic Updates** and update manually after reviewing changes.

## Step 9: Disable Handoff Between Devices

- Disable biometrics in high-risk environments like airports, protests, or borders.

## Step 13: Password Hygiene
- Avoid password reuse; use unique, strong passwords for every account.
- Store them in **Bitwarden** or **KeePassium** instead of iCloud Keychain.

## Step 14: Browser & Search Privacy
- Use Safari for most browsing, and a privacy browser like DuckDuckGo for disposable sessions.
