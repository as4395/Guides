# Evaluating App Privacy on the App Store

When downloading apps from the App Store, it’s important to evaluate whether they are privacy-conscious and understand the trade-offs of using free apps. Many free apps track a lot of data and have privacy-invasive policies.

### Step 1: Search for the App
- Let's say you are looking for a **decibel meter** app. You would search for **"dbmeter"** on the App Store.

### Step 2: Evaluate the App Privacy Section
- A popular app in the search results is **Decibel: db Sound Level Meter** by Vlad Polyanskiy.
- This app has **36k+ ratings** and is rated at **4.6 stars**, so it looks solid.
  
#### App Privacy Settings:
- Scroll down to the **App Privacy** section. You’ll see two categories:
  - **Data Linked to You**: This category includes **User Content**, meaning any data you upload, such as sound recordings, may be used by the developer.
  - **Data Not Linked to You**: This includes **Health & Fitness**, **Location**, **Usage Data**, **Purchases**, **Identifiers**, and **Diagnostics**. This data may be collected, but it's not linked to your identity.
  
For this app, the privacy policy shows that it collects a lot of unnecessary data. It’s concerning that so much information is being gathered when the app doesn’t even need to be connected to the Internet to function.

### Step 3: Compare with a Privacy-Conscious App
- **Proton Mail**, which I personally use for email, is a good example of a more privacy-conscious app.
- For Proton Mail, if you scroll down to the **App Privacy** section, you’ll only see the category **"Data Not Linked to You"**.
- The only data Proton Mail collects is **diagnostics**, typically to log any app crashes.
  
On macOS, I use **Little Snitch** to block analytics for apps I trust because I don’t want them calling home. **Proton Mail** even has an option to disable analytics under **Account Settings > Privacy and Data**. 

Unfortunately, **Little Snitch** isn’t available for iOS because Apple’s guidelines do not allow third-party apps to operate at the system level. However, iOS has an **App Privacy Report** feature that provides some insights into app network activity.

### Step 4: Research the App Developer's Privacy Policy
- Before installing any app, it’s a good idea to check the **app's privacy practices** and the **developer's privacy policy**.
- For example, with the **Decibel Meter** app, I visited the developer’s website ([https://decibelpro.app/](https://decibelpro.app/)) and reviewed the privacy policy.
  - In the privacy policy, I discovered that they are using **Google Analytics** and **Google Fonts**, meaning the app communicates a lot with Google.
  - The developer is based in **Russia**, which raises concerns due to the country’s weak privacy legislation and data protection laws.

### Step 5: Evaluate Alternative Apps
- Another decibel meter app, **NIOSH Sound Level Meter** by EA LAB, has decent ratings and is transparent about its data collection. The app does not collect any data at all, providing the same functionality as the other app without the privacy concerns.

### Step 6: What If Developers Lie About Data Collection?
- All app developers must provide a privacy policy and explicitly state what data they collect.
- If an app claims it’s not collecting data when it actually is, Apple will refuse the app submission.
- However, you should always verify these claims by looking into the privacy policy or researching the developer's background.

### Conclusion
When evaluating an app, consider the following:
1. **Check the App Privacy Report** on the App Store to see what data is being collected.
2. **Look for unnecessary data collection** like health, location, and usage data that an app doesn't need.
3. **Read the developer’s privacy policy** and make sure the data practices align with your privacy standards.
4. If possible, use apps that are transparent about their data practices and have minimal data collection.
